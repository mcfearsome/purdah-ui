## Goals

### Business Goals

- **Accelerate GPUI adoption** by reducing the barrier to entry for new developers
- **Establish industry standard** for GPUI component libraries and design patterns
- **Build developer community** around Purdah components with 500+ GitHub stars within 6 months
- **Reduce development time** by 70%+ for common UI patterns compared to raw GPUI
- **Enable internal velocity** for Purdah UI development with consistent, reusable components

### User Goals

- **Build UIs quickly** with pre-built components instead of starting from scratch
- **Maintain consistency** across applications with unified design system
- **Ship accessible applications** without manually implementing ARIA and keyboard navigation
- **Customize easily** through flexible theming system supporting light/dark modes

---

## User Experience

### Entry Point & Onboarding

- Developers discover Purdah Components through GitHub, Rust community forums, or Zed project references
- First-time users install via `cargo add purdah-gpui-components`
- Quick start guide shows "Hello World" button in under 5 minutes
- Interactive showcase app demonstrates all components visually
- Documentation progressively reveals complexity (start simple, add features incrementally)

### Core Experience

- **Step 1:** Developer adds library dependency to `Cargo.toml`
- **Step 2:** Import components via prelude: `use purdah_gpui_components::prelude::*;`
- **Step 3:** Build UI using chainable component API:
  ```rust
  Button::new()
      .label("Click me")
      .variant(ButtonVariant::Primary)
      .on_click(|_, cx| { /* handler */ })
  ```
- **Step 4:** Wrap app in ThemeProvider for consistent styling
- **Step 5:** Customize theme colors and spacing through token overrides
- **Step 6:** Iterate on UI using hot-reload (if GPUI supports)
- **Step 7:** Reference showcase app and docs for advanced patterns
- **Step 8:** Compose custom components by combining atoms and molecules

### Advanced Features & Edge Cases

- Power users can create custom themes by extending base themes
- Developers can build custom components following library patterns
- Components gracefully degrade when resources are unavailable (icons, fonts)
- Error states provide clear visual feedback (form validation, loading failures)
- Components handle edge cases (empty states, overflow, long text)

### UI/UX Highlights

- **Familiar patterns:** API similar to React components (props, state, events)
- **Visual consistency:** All components share design token system
- **Accessibility first:** Keyboard navigation and screen reader support by default
- **Performance maintained:** GPU-accelerated rendering preserved from GPUI
- **Dark mode ready:** Seamless theme switching without layout shift
- **Responsive design:** Components adapt to different window sizes

## Narrative

**Meet Sarah, a Rust developer building a code editor plugin**

Sarah has been building a syntax highlighting plugin for Zed using GPUI. She needs to create a settings panel with forms, buttons, and tabs, but she's spending more time fighting with layout and styling than writing plugin logic.

She discovers Purdah GPUI Components through the Zed community Discord. Within 10 minutes, she has a working settings panel:

```rust
VStack::new()
    .gap(theme.global.spacing_md)
    .children(vec![
        FormGroup::new()
            .label("Theme")
            .input(Dropdown::new().items(themes)),
        FormGroup::new()
            .label("Font Size")
            .input(Input::new().input_type(InputType::Number)),
        Button::new()
            .label("Save Settings")
            .variant(ButtonVariant::Primary)
            .on_click(|_, cx| { /* save */ }),
    ])
```

The components automatically handle focus states, keyboard navigation, and dark mode. Sarah spends the rest of her afternoon implementing plugin features instead of wrestling with UI primitives.

Two weeks later, her plugin has 500+ users, many praising the "polished UI" and "great accessibility." Sarah didn't have to think about ARIA labels, focus management, or theme tokens – Purdah Components handled it all.
